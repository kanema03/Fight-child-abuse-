	<!--Symptoms of child abuse-->
	<div class="card">
		<center><h2>Symptoms</h2></center>
		<h3>
<p>
A child who's being abused may feel guilty, ashamed or confused
. He or she may be afraid to tell anyone about the abuse, especially
if the abuser is a parent, other relative or family friend. That's why
 it's vital to watch for red flags, such as:
<ul>
	<li>
Withdrawal from friends or usual activities
</li>
<li>
Changes in behavior — such as aggression, anger, hostility or hyperactivity — or changes in school performance
</li>
<li>
Depression, anxiety or unusual fears, or a sudden loss of self-confidence
</li>
<li>
An apparent lack of supervision
</li>
<li>
Frequent absences from school
</li>
<li>
Reluctance to leave school activities, as if he or she doesn't want to go home
</li>
<li>
Attempts at running away
</li>
<li>
Rebellious or defiant behavior
</li>
<li>
	Self-harm or attempts at suicide
</li>
</h3>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<p>
	<h3>
	Specific signs and symptoms depend on the type of 
	abuse and can vary. Keep in mind that warning signs
	are just that — warning signs. The presence of warning
	signs doesn't necessarily mean that a child is being abused.
    <br>
	<h3>
Unexplained injuries, such as bruises, fractures or burns
Injuries that don't match the given explanation
</h3>
<br>
<h2>Sexual abuse signs and symptoms</h2>

Sexual behavior or knowledge that's inappropriate for the child's age
Pregnancy or a sexually transmitted infection

<br>
Blood in the child's underwear

Statements that he or she was sexually abused
<br>
Inappropriate sexual contact with other children

<br>

<h2>Emotional abuse signs and symptoms</h2>

Delayed or inappropriate emotional development
<br>
Loss of self-confidence or self-esteem
<br>
Social withdrawal or a loss of interest or enthusiasm
Depression
<br>
Avoidance of certain situations, such as refusing to go to school or ride the bus
Desperately seeks affection
<br>
A decrease in school performance or loss of interest in school
<br>
Loss of previously acquired developmental skills

<h2>Neglect signs and symptoms</h2>
Poor growth or weight gain or being overweight
<br>

Poor hygiene
<br>
Lack of clothing or supplies to meet physical needs
<br>
Taking food or money without permission
<br>
Hiding food for later
<br>
Poor record of school attendance
<br>
Lack of appropriate attention for medical, dental or psychological problems or lack of necessary follow-up care
Parental behavior
<br>

Sometimes a parent's demeanor or behavior sends red flags about child abuse. Warning signs include a parent who:

Shows little concern for the child
Appears unable to recognize physical or emotional distress in the child
Blames the child for the problems
Consistently belittles or berates the child, and describes the child with negative terms, such as "worthless" or "evil"
Expects the child to provide him or her with attention and care and seems jealous of other family members getting attention from the child
Uses harsh physical discipline
Demands an inappropriate level of physical or academic performance
Severely limits the child's contact with others
Offers conflicting or unconvincing explanations for a child's injuries or no explanation at all
Child health experts condemn the use of violence in any form, but some people still use corporal punishment, such as spanking, as a way to discipline their children. Any corporal punishment may leave emotional scars. Parental behaviors that cause pain, physical injury or emotional trauma — even when done in the name of discipline — could be child abuse.

	<p><h3>
		The impact of child maltreatment can be profound.
		Research shows that child maltreatment is associated
		with adverse health and mental health outcomes in children
		and families, and those negative effects can last a lifetime.
		In addition to the impact on the child, child abuse and neglect
		also has profound, broad implications on communities. One analysis
		of the immediate and long-term economic impact of child abuse and 
		neglect suggests that child maltreatment costs the nation as much as
		k258 million each day, or approximately K94 billion each year.

<h2><center>Befits of preventing child abuse</center></h2>
		
<p>
	<h3>
	   The emotional and physical damage a 
	   child may suffer from abuse and neglect
	   is extensive. Documented consequences of
	   maltreatment include chronic health problems,
	   cognitive and language disorders, and socio-emotional
	   problems such as low self-esteem, lack of trust, and poor
	   relationships with adults and peers.
	 <br>  
	 Child abuse and neglect prevention activities help keep abuse
	  and neglect from happening in the first place. Prevention activities
	   help lower a child’s risk of having learning, emotional, and social 
	   issues later in life. This benefits the child, any children they may
		have in the future, and society overall
